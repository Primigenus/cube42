Cube 42
=======

Cube 42 is a 3d puzzle game. 26 blocks arranged in a 3x3x3 cube make up the game. Each block represents a number between 1 and 9.
Each level, the player is challenged to remove blocks from the cube until each face of the cube totals 42.
Removing just one cube is easy, but the difficulty quickly ramps up as the player progresses through levels until level 4, where 4 cubes must be removed in order to solve the puzzle.

The game is implemented in HTML, CSS and Coffeescript, depending largely on 3d CSS managed with -webkit-transform. It can only be played on desktops.
